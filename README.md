# README-Generator

* As a developer, I want to be able to use the terminal to create a README file.

## Description
* This app allows you to run node index.js after completing your project so that you make create a README file. It will
ask you questions about all the main topics that would show up into a professional README. If an answer is left blank then the
terminal will notify you that you have to put in an answer about the certain field before it can continue. 

## Usage
* You will run node index.js in the terminal and it will start the program and ask you the series of questions.

## Install
* If you do not have node installed already, you will need to install node for this program to work in the terminal.
